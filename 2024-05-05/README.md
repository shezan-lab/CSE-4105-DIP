1. Separate the R,G,B component from an RGB image? Suppose the image variable is im(255 by 255 by 3) then show the spectral correlation between the bands.
2. Find 2 images from the Internet where one is blurred and the other one is sharp. Average out the both images with spatial filtering and display the difference.
