# Task 1

I will provide the image path (use opencv)
Get the correlation between odd pixels and even pixels of a image. print it.
also scatter the plot (use matplot lib) of odd indexed pixel and even indexed pixel
provide full code with python (use raw python code and minimize use of third party libraries)

# Task 2

Python Code - opencv, numpy, matplotlib (Use raw code more than 3rd party libraries)
Show spectral correlation (Red vs Green, Green vs Blue, Blue vs Red) between different channel of a image with scattering plot
