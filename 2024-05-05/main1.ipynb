    "Our goal in this lab exercise was to extract the RGB (red, green, and blue) components from an image. The cv2.split() function was utilized to split the image into its individual color channels. In order to investigate the spectral correlation between each pair of color channels (R-G, R-B, and G-B), we next computed the correlation coefficients between them. We may better comprehend the links between the image's various color channels thanks to this study. In order to see any possible patterns or links in the image data, we lastly made scatter plots for each pair of color channels to visualize the spectral correlation.\n",

    "In this lab task, we aimed to compare the effects of spatial filtering on two images: one blurred and one sharp. We loaded the images, converted them to grayscale for processing ease, and then applied average spatial filtering using a box blur filter to both images. By subtracting the filtered versions of the images from each other, we computed the difference, which highlights areas of discrepancy between the two. This allows us to visually discern the impact of blurring on image sharpness and to evaluate the efficacy of spatial filtering in image enhancement."
